# predatorieprede02

A simple engine that simulates an environment with two types of organisms:
* preys, which move around randomly and multiply;
* predators, which move on preys to eat, otherwise move randomly (and eventually starve), and multiply.

This engine was born as a simple programming exercise from a textbook. On the other hand, the broader idea is to create an extensible engine where classes can be inherited to produce a richer environment.

Ideally, on the long run, it should become possible to add an evolutionary engine based on which different versions of each type of organism compete for survival.
